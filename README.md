# MATLAB Toolbox for fdipa, feasible direction interior-point algorithm

MATLAB library to find minimum of nonlinear second-order cone programming problem, using the feasible direction interior-point algorithm (fdipa) as presented in [1].

## Download 
Option 1: From a MATLAB command prompt run:
```
git clone https://github.com/fdipaSOC/NSOCP
```
Option 2: run script "fdipa_setup.m" included in the library folder

## Install in MATLAB
From a MATLAB command window:

```
addpath( genpath('AbsolutePathToToolbox') )
```
where `AbsolutePathToToolbox` is the name of the absolute path where you cloned this toolbox. 
Adding this command to your MATLAB `startup.m` file will make sure these tools are avalible every time you
use MATLAB.

## Documentation

[Documentation PDF](documentation/doc_fdipa.pdf)

## Contents
The scripts are organized in the following folders:

* `fdipa`: source files for fdipa algorithm. 
  * `fdipa/fdipa.m`: solves a random linear programming problem using either interface.
  * `fdipa/fdipaQuad.m`: solves a random linear programming problem using either interface.
* `documentation`: source files for the documentation
* `example1_quadratic`: example of application of fdipaQuad to a quadratic problem with linear cone constraints.
* `example2_kato`: Kato-Fukushima example of for nonlinear second-order cone programs as presented in [2].
* `example3_miao`: Miao-Chen-Ko example of nonlinear convex programs with second-order cone constraints as presented in [3].
* `example4_hyf_nonlinear`: Example of nonlinear problem with linear constraints used in Example 4.2 of [4] (also  used in Ex. 5.3 of [3]).
* `example5_dist_ellip`: application of fdipaQuad to the problem of distance between two ellipses.
* `example6_cubic`: example of cubic objective function with linear constraints.
* `example7_rotated_conic`: example of a quadratic objective with rotated conic constraints.
* `example8_svm`: Application to support vector machines (Requires CVX).
